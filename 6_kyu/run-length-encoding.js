// ðŸ“Œ DESCRIPTION:

// Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

// Task
// Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

// Examples
// As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:


// ðŸ’¡ SOLUTION:

var runLengthEncoding = function(str){
    let arr = [[]];
     str.split('').forEach((item,index) => arr[arr.length-1][1] === item ? arr[arr.length-1][0]+=1: arr.push([1,item]))
     arr.shift();
     return arr
   }
 console.log(runLengthEncoding("WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"));
